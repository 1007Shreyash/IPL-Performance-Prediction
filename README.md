# Cricket Player Performance Prediction (IPL)

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project applies machine learning to historical IPL data (2008-2024) to predict individual player performance (runs for batsmen, wickets for bowlers) in upcoming matches[cite: 4].

## Goals

1. [cite_start]**Predict Runs:** Estimate runs scored by a batsman in a specific match[cite: 10].
2. [cite_start]**Predict Wickets:** Estimate wickets taken by a bowler[cite: 11].
3. [cite_start]**Dashboard:** Deploy an interactive Streamlit app for users[cite: 18].

## Tech Stack

- [cite_start]**Language:** Python 3.x [cite: 28]
- [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit [cite: 28]
- [cite_start]**Data Source:** Kaggle IPL Ball-by-Ball Dataset [cite: 28]

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model experiments.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `models/`: Trained ML models (to be added).

## Milestones
